1. True - variables exist until the end of the block in which they are declared.
2. False - ArrayLists tend to be slower than regular arrays.
3. False - They can hold an arbitrary # of dimensions.
4. False - You can set the input to be the keyboard, a file, or something else.
5. True - it can hold either primitive values or references to objects.
6. False - Logic errors are devious because you may not even know you have one!  Run-time errors will crash with an exception (unless you catch them).
7. OK - Converts 2.111 to a byte, 2, then puts the byte into an int.
8. Error - Converts 2 into a float, 2.000, and then tries to put a float into an int.
9. OK - 17 is implicitly cast into a float.
10. OK - Explicitly cast to a short, 2, and put into the short variable.
11. OK - Explicitly cast 1 to a double, 1.000, and put the double value into a double variable.
12. True - F || T 
13. False - F && T
14. False - (T || T) && F -> T && F
15. True - F || T
16. True - T && T
17. False - !(T) && T -> F && T
18. javac - The java compiler
19. value - A copy of the value in the variable is sent to the method!
20. block - This block can be a method, for loop block, class, etc.
21. Dynamically sized, automatically resizes, details abstracted away, easier to use, etc.
22. c -= 2; OR c = c - 2;
