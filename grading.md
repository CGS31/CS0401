# Grading Guidelines

_Individual projects will have a rubric explaining the grading guidelines for that specific project._

The quality of your code and write-up can and will impact your grade.  For a perfect grade, I expect college-level quality on ALL aspects of your project, including:

1. Proper grammar, punctuation, etc. in write-ups.
2. No commented-out code, UNLESS there is a specified reason for it, e.g.:
   * `// This doesn't work, but this is what I would do if I could...`
   * `// Uncomment the following line to run additional long-running tests)`
3. No inconsistent spacing/tabs/brace settings.  I don't care which you use, but make it consistent.
