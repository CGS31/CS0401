Everybody is expected to do their own work.  Any student caught collaborating or cheating on an exam will automatically receive a 0 (zero) for that exam or project, and may be penalized more harshly for egregious offenses (up to automatic failure of the course).  A second time caught collaborating or cheating will result in automatic failure of the course, at a minimum, and may be subject to further measures based on University of Pittsburgh academic policy.

For submissions which are too similar to be chance, _all_ parties will be considered to have cheated.  Keep your code safe to avoid this!

Information on the course will be posted regularly on the class github repo.  Announcements will be posted in the file announcements.md.  While the professor will endeavour to post all relevant information on this site, there may be additional information discussed in class which is not posted.

It is recommended you keep all of your graded assignments until final
grades are posted and accepted, in order to resolve any discrepancies
in grading.

## Attendance

Students are strongly encouraged to attend all lectures and labs, which may include material not taken from the text.  If a student misses a lecture, they are resposible for the material covered.

Presence for the quizzes, mid-term, and final (cumulative) exam are REQUIRED.
They will be individually re-scheduled only in the event of an emergency.
If you are facing an emergency, please contact the instructor IMMEDIATELY (if
it is safe to do so, of course).  Failure to show up for an exam
without clearing it first with the instructor will result in a 0
(zero) for that exam.  

## Programming Environment

All programs should be written in Java, using the Java 2 SDK (JDK), version 1.7 or later.  The choice of editor, IDE, etc. are up to you, although it is recommended you use the latest version of Eclipse.
