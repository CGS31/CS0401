## Grading

* Mid-term Exam #1 - 20%
* Mid-term Exam #2 - 20%
* Programming Projects: 30%
* Quizzes: 10%
* Labs: 20%


The following grading scale will be used.

Score  | Grade
-----: | ------------------------------
100.00-93.00 | A (A+ for extraordinary work, or >100)
92.99-91.00  | A-
90.99-89.00  | B+
88.99-83.00  | B
82.99-81.00 | B-
80.99-79.00 | C+
78.99-72.00 | C
73.99-70.00 | C-
69.99-64.00 | D+
63.99-55.00 | D
54.99-50.00 | D-
49.99-0.00 | F

Everybody is expected to do their own work.  Any student caught collaborating or cheating on an exam will automatically receive a 0 (zero) for that exam or project, and may be penalized more harshly for egregious offenses (up to automatic failure of the course).  A second time caught collaborating or cheating will result in automatic failure of the course, at a minimum, and may be subject to further measures based on University of Pittsburgh academic policy.

For submissions which are too similar to be chance, _all_ parties will be considered to have cheated.  Keep your code safe to avoid this!

Information on the course will be posted regularly on the class github repo.  Announcements will be posted in the file announcements.md.  While the professor will endeavour to post all relevant information on this site, there may be additional information discussed in class which is not posted.

There will be four or five Java program submissions during the course.  These need to be turned at the beginning of the class on the due date.  If a late date option is available for a project, the project must be submitted on the late due date by 11:59 PM and will be penalized 15 percentage points (e.g., if your program would have received a 90, but it was turned in late, it will receive 90 - 15, or 75).

It is recommended you keep all of your graded assignments until final
grades are posted and accepted, in order to resolve any discrepancies
in grading.

## Attendance

Students are strongly encouraged to attend all lectures and labs, which may include material not taken from the text.  If a student misses a lecture, they are resposible for the material covered.

There are thirteen labs throughout the semester.  Of these, your top ten out of thirteen will count for your lab grade (2% each).  I _highly_ recommend you go to all of the labs, but in case you have to miss one or don't do well on some of them, your grade will not be affected.

Presence for the quizzes and exams are *required*. They will be individually re-scheduled only in the event of an emergency. If you are facing an emergency, please contact the instructor *immediately* (if it is safe to do so, of course).  Failure to show up for a quiz or  exam without clearing it first with the instructor will result in a 0 (zero) for that exam.  

## Programming Environment

All programs should be written in Java, using the Java 2 SDK (JDK), version 1.8.  The choice of editor, operating system, etc. are up to you.

## Quizzes

Two quizzes, each worth 5% of the grade, will be given.  These will be during labs and announced at least one class or lab ahead of time.  They will cover material found in the previous classes and labs.

## Mid-Terms

Two mid-terms, each worth 20% of the grade, will be given.  These will be given during class.

## Extra Credit

There is an opportunity for _up to_ two percentage points of extra credit (e.g., if you got a 91 in the class, you can get up to a 93 for the final grade) for using the Knowledge Tree Portal - http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/kt/content/Show.  More details will be announced during the second lecture of class.

Log In Information: Your username is your pitt username (e.g., wjl23).  Your password is your 7-digit PeopleSoft number.  If you have any questions or problems, please email jdg60 at pitt dot edu.

No other extra credit opportunities will be available!
