* All material covered in class (up to and including 23 Sep)!

* Understand:
  * Basics of Java
    * Difference between `javac` and `java`
    * Platform-independent - what does that mean?
    * What is the JVM?
    * What is the JDK?
  * Basic I/O
    * System.out - printing out strings and variables
    * What is difference between print, println, printf?
      * For printf - know _basic_ syntax: %f, %d, decimal places and 0-padding
  * Variables
    * Understand primitive vs reference variables
    * Different primitive types: boolean, byte, short, int, long, char, double, float
    * Understand casting and its pitfalls
    * Understand implicit casting (e.g., you can use an int as a long, but not a long as an int)
    * Declaration and assignment
  * Operators and expressions
    * Basic numeric operators (+, -, *, /)
    * Integer division and modulo operator (/, %)
    * Precedence
      * I do not expect you to know entire precedence ordering
      * However, understand difference in precedence for +,- and *,/
    * Associativity
  * Convenience operators / "syntactic sugar"
    * ++, --, +=, etc.
    * Prefix vs postfix
  * Understand using Scanner
    * .next() vs .nextInt(), .nextFloat(), etc.
    * .hasNextInt(), .hasNextFloat(), etc.
    * Remember to import!
    * What kind of errors can we get using Scanner?
      * Run-time InputMismatchException
      * Infinite loops
  * Control Statement Basics
    * Linear, conditional, iterative execution
  * Boolean expressions
    * Given an English sentence, translate it to Boolean expression
    * Relational operators
      * < <= > >= == !=
    * Logical operators
      * ! && ||
  * If statements (conditionals)
    * If..
    * If.. else
    * If.. else if.. etc.
    * Nested if statements
  * Errors
    * Syntax error
    * Run-time error
    * Logic error
  * While loops
    * Do.. while. Why use one or the other?
  * For loop
    * Used mostly as a counting loop
    * Understand syntax of this one!
      * Initial expression
      * Conditional expression
      * Incremental expression
  * Nested loops (while or for)
  * switch Statements
    * Basic switch case statement
    * Be able to trace execution!
    * Understand breaks in switch statements
  * Methods
    * Basic syntax
    * Static vs instance methods
    * Parameters vs arguments
    * Arguments passed by value
    * Function vs procedure
