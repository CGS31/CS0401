Create a _private_ repo and share it with your TA by the time the program is due (see above).

If you do not yet have the ability to make a private repo (because your student pack has not yet come in, for example), please hold off on pushing to GitHub.  You may want to work on the project, then copy it into a repo later.

Please include all source files (i.e., .java files) necessary for your program to compile and run.  There should be no .class files, Eclipse-related files, etc.  Remember you can use `git rm _filename_` to remove files from git, if you accidentally add some.

You will need to turn in a submission sheet with your assignment (see submission_sheet.md).  Please fill out all the required sections.  This should be _printed out_ and turned in in class - do not add it to the GitHub repo.

Extra credit is at the discretion of the grader, but will not be more than five points.  Some ideas for extra credit are listed at the end of the assignment.
