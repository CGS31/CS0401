This is a generalized grading rubric for assigment 2.  

### Functionality (~80% of grade)

Think of it as a checklist for what your program needs to do.  These are all worth roughly equal amounts of points when grading.

1. Properly loops and quits when there are no more customers
2. Allows users to buy different kinds of pizza
2. Allows users to buy pizza only by the pie
2. Allows users to buy pie only by the slice
2. Properly calculates number of whole pies based on number of slices
2. Calculates total bill, including subtotal / total
2. Able to ask for amount tendered and loop until it is enough money
2. All currency values properly formatted and displayed
2. Gives proper change to customers
2. Asks for and correctly calculates Pie Card discounts
2. Properly handles invalid or unexpected values.  NOTE: You may assume that all values will be of the correct type.  For example, if you expect 1 or 2, the grader may try typing in 7 or -54, but will not type in "pollywollydoodle".

Note that partial credit will be given.

However, a program which does not compile or does not execute at all will receive only minimal credit.

### 

"Code aesthetics" - proper variable naming, proper indentation, etc. - can count for up to 10% of the grade except for particularly egregious cases (e.g., turning in your entire assignment on one line, or variable names which are vulgar or insulting).

###

The final 10% of your grade is from turning it in properly, including the submission sheet and setting only the proper users as collaborators on your private repo.
