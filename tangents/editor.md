## Which Editor Should I Use?

We discussed some editors in class on Monday, but I did not go into detail.  Here is where you can research them on your own, along with a few of my comments.

* Sublime Text - Very popular, somewhat powerful, and easy to use text editor. It is shareware, so you will be asked to pay for it, although you are not forced to do so. http://www.sublimetext.com/

* Notepad++ - A free, Windows-only editor.  Relatively simple and easy to understand.  Not as many features as other editors listed here, but probably the simplest to learn. https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.8.2.html

* Vim - A very powerful editor, but with a steep learning curve.  It is a "modal" editor, meaning that what you depends on what mode you're in; for example, typing `$` in command mode means "go to the end of the current line", but in insert mode it means "put the character $ on the screen". http://www.vim.org/

* Emacs - A very powerful free (see https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html) editor, with many tools built-in.  Emacs was written a long time ago, before many keyboard combinations became "standard", and so may seem a little odd. For example, "cut" is control-W, "paste" is meta-Y, and "cancel' is control-G. https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/

* Eclipse - Technically an IDE, not an editor.  Open-source.  Includes lots of Java-specific tools to allow for all development to be done in a single environment. http://www.eclipse.org/home/index.php

There are many other text editors out there.  Wikipedia has a good comparison of many of them: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_text_editors


## Amount of DNA in an average human

According to a standard biology textbook, a single human cell has 3.0 meters of DNA. (source: http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1998/StevenChen.shtml)

A paper estimates that there are 3.72e13 cells in an average human, or 37.2 trillion cells. (source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23829164)

This comes out to a total of 111.6e14 meters. A light-year is 9.46e15 meters, so the total DNA distance comes out to 4.3 light-days.
