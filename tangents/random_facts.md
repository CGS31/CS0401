## Amount of DNA in an average human

Google has over 2 billion lines of code in their codebase (counting all of their various projects) https://webmail.pitt.edu/webmail/src/webmail.php

According to a standard biology textbook, a single human cell has 3.0 meters of DNA. (source: http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1998/StevenChen.shtml)

A paper estimates that there are 3.72e13 cells in an average human, or 37.2 trillion cells. (source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23829164)

This comes out to a total of 111.6e14 meters. A light-year is 9.46e15 meters, so the total DNA distance comes out to 4.3 light-days.
