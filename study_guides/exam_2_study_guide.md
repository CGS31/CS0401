This exam is _not_ cumulative, except that all programming is cumulative in that you need to understand, e.g., how variables work before you can worry about recursion.  The exam will be on everything from the class before Exam 1 (the midterm) - if you'll recall, I did not include ArrayLists on the first exam since we only covered them the day before.

Particular topics to review include the following.  Note that just because it is not on this list does not mean that it will not be on the test!  Everything that we have discussed in class is fair game.

* Multi-Dimensional arrays
  * Traversing / Accessing
  * Modifying
  * Creating
  * Limitations
  * How they are actually stored (arrays of arrays of arrays..)

* ArrayLists
  * Benefits
  * Drawbacks
  * Basic syntax
  * Uses

* Searching
  * Definition and concepts
  * Binary search 
  * Sequential search
  * When to use either?
